The Debian Package nsenter
----------------------------

A simple package that provides nsenter from util-linux that's missing
on Debian/Ubuntu.  Also, I've included the docker-enter script to easily
spawn a process under a Docker container.

Inspired by https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter

The docker-enter script is directly taken from the above.  There appears
to be no license on it.  However, util-linux is GPLv2.
